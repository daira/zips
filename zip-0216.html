            <p>This ZIP fixes an oversight in the implementation of the Sapling consensus rules, by rejecting all non-canonical representations of Jubjub points.</p>

            <p>The Sapling specification was originally written with the intent that all values, including Jubjub points, are strongly typed with canonical representations. <a id="footnote-reference-5" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-jubjub">9</a> This has significant advantages for security analysis, because it allows the protocol to be modelled with just the abstract types.</p>
            <p>The intention of the Jubjub implementation (both in the <cite>jubjub</cite> crate <a id="footnote-reference-6" class="footnote_reference" href="#jubjub-crate">20</a> and its prior implementations) was to ensure that only canonical point encodings would be accepted by the decoding logic. However, an oversight in the implementation allowed an edge case to slip through: for each point on the curve where the
                <span class="math">\(u\!\)</span>
            -coordinate is zero, there are two encodings that will be accepted:</p>
            <pre data-language="rust"><span class="c1">// Fix the sign of `u` if necessary</span>

            <p>This code accepts either sign bit, because <code>u_negated == u</code>.</p>
            <p>There are two points on the Jubjub curve with
                <span class="math">\(u\!\)</span>
            -coordinate zero:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span class="math">\((0, 1)\)</span>
                , which is the identity;</li>
                <li>
                    <span class="math">\((0, -1)\)</span>
                , which is a point of order two.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each of these has a single non-canonical encoding in which the value of the sign bit is
                <span class="math">\(1\)</span>
            .</p>
            <p>This creates a consensus issue because (unlike other non-canonical point encodings that are rejected) either of the above encodings can be decoded, and then re-encoded to a <em>different</em> encoding. For example, if a non-canonical encoding appeared in a transaction field, then node implementations that store points internally as abstract curve points, and used those to derive transaction IDs, would derive different IDs than nodes which store transactions as bytes (such as <cite>zcashd</cite>).</p>
            <p>This issue is not known to cause any security vulnerability, beyond the risk of consensus incompatibility. In fact, for some of the fields that would otherwise be affected, the issue does not occur because there are already consensus rules that prohibit small-order points, and this incidentally prohibits non-canonical encodings.</p>
            <p>Adjustments to the protocol specification were made in versions 2020.1.8, 2020.1.9, 2020.1.15, and 2021.1.17 to match the <cite>zcashd</cite> implementation. (The fact that this required 4 specification revisions to get right, conclusively demonstrates the problem.)</p>

             bits,
                <span class="math">\(b\)</span>

            .</p>
            <p>Non-normative note: There are two such bit sequences,
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{I2LEOSP}_{\ell_{\mathbb{J}}}(2^{255} + 1)\)</span>
             and

            . The Sapling protocol uses little-endian ordering when converting between bit and byte sequences, so the first of these sequences corresponds to a
                <span class="math">\(\mathtt{0x01}\)</span>
             byte, followed by
                <span class="math">\(30\)</span>
             zero bytes, and then a

             byte.</p>
            <p>Once this ZIP activates, the following places within the Sapling consensus protocol where Jubjub points occur MUST reject non-canonical Jubjub point encodings.</p>

            <p>These fields cannot by consensus contain small-order points. All of the points with non-canonical encodings are small-order.</p>
            <p>Implementations MAY choose to reject non-canonical encodings of the above four fields early in decoding of a transaction. This eliminates the risk that parts of the transaction could be re-serialized from their internal representation to a different byte sequence than in the original transaction, e.g. when calculating transaction IDs.</p>
            <p>In addition, Sapling addresses and full viewing keys MUST be considered invalid when imported if they contain non-canonical Jubjub point encodings, or encodings of points that are not in the prime-order subgroup

                <p>As originally specified, this ZIP required that the new validity rules be applied only after NU5 activation. This was necessary because a transaction containing a non-canonical Jubjub point encoding could have been included in any block before NU5 activation.</p>
                <p>However, now that NU5 is a settled upgrade on the Zcash Mainnet and Testnet chains <a id="footnote-reference-19" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-blockchain">3</a> <a id="footnote-reference-20" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-networks">4</a>, it can be observed that there were no such non-canonical encodings in publically visible transaction fields before the Mainnet and Testnet NU5 activations. Therefore, a full validator MAY enforce the above specification retroactively.</p>
                <p>It remains possible that there could be non-canonical

                 field of a Sapling transmitted note ciphertext. Such encodings MUST be rejected by the decryption procedure in <a id="footnote-reference-21" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-decryptovk">8</a> after NU5 activation. An implementation MAY also reject them before NU5 activation. Doing so cannot lead to loss of funds sent to a Sapling address that has been correctly generated as specified in <a id="footnote-reference-22" class="footnote_reference" href="#protocol-saplingkeycomponents">5</a>, because such an address cannot have
                    <span class="math">\(\mathsf{ivk} = 0\!\)</span>

            <p>Zcash previously had a similar issue with non-canonical representations of points in Ed25519 public keys and signatures. In that case, given the prevalence of Ed25519 signatures in the wider ecosystem, the decision was made in ZIP 215 <a id="footnote-reference-24" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0215">18</a> (which activated with the Canopy network upgrade <a id="footnote-reference-25" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0251">19</a>) to allow non-canonical representations of points.</p>
            <p>In Sapling, we are motivated instead to reject these non-canonical points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The chance of the identity occurring anywhere within the Sapling components of transactions from implementations following the standard protocol is cryptographically negligible.</li>
                <li>This re-enables the aforementioned simpler security analysis of the Sapling protocol.</li>
                <li>The Jubjub curve has a vastly-smaller scope of usage in the general cryptographic ecosystem than Curve25519 and Ed25519.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The necessary checks are very simple and do not require cryptographic operations, therefore the performance impact will be negligible.</p>
            <p>The public inputs of Jubjub points to the Spend circuit (
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{rk}\)</span>
             and
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{cv^{old}}\)</span>
            ) and Output circuit (
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{cv^{new}}\)</span>
             and
                <span class="math">\(\mathsf{epk}\)</span>
            ) are not affected because they are represented in affine coordinates as elements of the correct field (
                <span class="math">\(\mathbb{F}_{r_\mathbb{S}} = \mathbb{F}_{q_\mathbb{J}}\)</span>
            ), and so no issue of encoding canonicity arises.</p>
