            <p>This proposal disables the ability to add new value to the Sprout chain value pool balance. This takes a step toward being able to remove the Sprout shielded protocol, thus reducing the overall complexity and attack surface of Zcash.</p>

        <section id="motivation"><h2><span class="section-heading">Motivation</span><span class="section-anchor"> <a rel="bookmark" href="#motivation"><img width="24" height="24" class="section-anchor" src="assets/images/section-anchor.png" alt=""></a></span></h2>
            <p>The first iteration of the Zcash network, called Sprout, provided a shielded payment protocol that was relatively closely based on the original Zerocash proposal. <a id="footnote-reference-6" class="footnote_reference" href="#zerocash">8</a></p>
            <p>The Sapling network upgrade <a id="footnote-reference-7" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0205">4</a> introduced significant efficiency and functionality improvements for shielded transactions. It is expected that over time, the use of Sapling will replace the use of Sprout in shielded transactions.</p>
            <p>The Sapling and Sprout shielded protocols employ different cryptographic designs. Since an adversary could potentially exploit any vulnerability in either design, supporting both presents additional risk over supporting only the newer Sapling shielded protocol.</p>
            <p>For example, a vulnerability was discovered in the zero-knowledge proving system originally used by Zcash that could have allowed counterfeiting <a id="footnote-reference-8" class="footnote_reference" href="#counterfeiting">9</a>. While this particular vulnerability was addressed (also for Sprout shielded transactions) by the Sapling upgrade, and we are not aware of others at the time of writing, the possibility of other cryptographic weaknesses cannot be entirely ruled out.</p>
            <p>In addition, the Zcash specification and implementation incurs complexity and "technical debt" from the requirement to support and test both shielded payment protocols.</p>
            <p>Removing the ability to add to the Sprout chain value pool balance, is a first step toward reducing this complexity and potential risk. This does not prevent extracting value held in Sprout addresses and sending it to transparent addresses, or to Sapling addresses via the migration tool <a id="footnote-reference-9" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0308">7</a>.</p>

            <p>Consensus rule: From the relevant activation height, the <code>vpub_old</code> field of each JoinSplit description MUST be zero.</p>
            <p>When this proposal is activated, nodes and wallets MUST disable any facilities to create transactions that have both one or more outputs to Sprout addresses, and one or more inputs from non-Sprout addresses. This SHOULD be made clear in user interfaces and API documentation.</p>
            <p>Notes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The requirement on wallets is intentionally slightly stronger than that enforced by the consensus rule. It is possible to construct a mixed transaction with inputs from both Sprout and non-Sprout addresses, in which all <code>vpub_old</code> fields are zero, but there are nevertheless sufficient funds from Sprout inputs to balance the Sprout outputs. This is prohibited for usability reasons, but not by consensus.</li>
                <li>The facility to send to Sprout addresses, even before activation of this proposal, is OPTIONAL for a particular node or wallet implementation.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This design does not require any change to the JoinSplit circuit, thus minimizing the risk of security regressions, and avoiding the need for a new ceremony to generate circuit parameters.</p>
            <p>The code changes needed are very small and simple, and their security is easy to analyse.</p>
            <p>During the development of this proposal, alternative designs were considered that would have removed some fields of a JoinSplit description. These alternatives were abandoned for several reasons:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Privacy concerns raised as a consequence of preventing the use of internal change between JoinSplits, and/or change sent back to the input Sprout addresses. This would have required the total value of the input Sprout notes (or, for some considered designs, the total value of the two Sprout inputs to each JoinSplit) to be leaked. As it is, there is an unavoidable leak of the total value extracted from the Sprout value pool, but not of the sum of values of particular subsets of notes.</li>
                <li>Modifications would have been needed to the design of the Sprout to Sapling migration procedure described in <a id="footnote-reference-10" class="footnote_reference" href="#zip-0308">7</a>.</li>
                <li>A new transaction version would have been required.</li>

            <p>Since all clients change their behaviour at the same time from this proposal's activation height, there is no additional client distinguisher.</p>
